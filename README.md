# 1111111
Made for GMTK Game Jam 2019. The theme for the game jam was "only one", as in "only one bullet" for a shooter or "only one jump" for a platformer.

1111111 is a math based puzzle game where you have to perform mathematical operations using only the number 1 to reach a given number. So for example given four 1's and the operations \+ \+ and \*, reach the number 4, one solution would be (1+1)\*(1+1)

The game itself is currently incomplete, though the user interface is in place to drag blocks with the different numbers and operations around.
